# BitcoinExplainer

Bitcoin is a complex thing and not very easy to explain to someone who wants to know how it works, especially if they're non technical, as you first need to explain a lot of other concepts. Many attempts at explaining Bitcoin oversimplify and miss a lot out. On the other hand an evangelist will often start on a deep dive of the block chain when the person asking only wanted a simple answer.

In this document I've attempted to explain the fundamentals of how Bitcoin actually works without delving into too much technical detail.
Why 2 pages? You could easily write a book trying to explain exactly how Bitcoin works but most people are simply not interested in that level of detail. Instead they want something actionable that will tell them how to use it while giving some understanding of what it actually is. I simply couldn't do justice to it in a single page-too much would have been missed out, I found 2 pages to be a dcent compromise between explaining enough and brevity.

If you have friends or family members who ask about Bitcoin or if you're trying to understand it for yourself, I believe this will do better than most videos and websites. While I've tried to explain things simply it's still fairly dense with information so I recommend reading it a couple of times.
